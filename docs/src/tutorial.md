## Building Contracts with Primitive and Derived Types

Most of the types defined in Miletus are built upon a small set abstract types (`Contract`, `Observable{T}`, `Process{T}`, `TermStruct`, `DayCount`, `AbstractModel`), and each of the primitive combinators described in the original PJ&E papers are implemented as a `typealias` of a set of Julia types having one of these abstract types as a super type.

### Contract primitives

The set of `Contract` primitives includes the following types:

* `Zero()`

    * A "null" contract
* `Amount(o::Observable)`

    * Receive an amount of the observable object `o`
* `Scale(s::Observable, c::Contract)`

    * Scale the contract `c` by `s`
* `Both(c1::Contract, c2::Contract)`

    * Acquire both contracts `c1` and `c2`
    * This type corresponds to the `and` combinator in the PJ&E papers.
* `Either(c1::Contract, c2::Contract)`

    * Acquire either contract `c1` or `c2`
    * This type corresponds to the `or` combinator in the PJ&E papers.
* `Give(c::Contract)`

    * Take the opposite side of contract `c`
    * Acquires the rights to contract `c` as an obligation
* `Cond(p::Observable{Bool}, c1::Contract, c2::Contract)`

    * If expression `p` is true at the point of acquisition, then acquire contract `c1`, otherwise acquire contract `c2`
* `When(p::Observable{Bool}, c::Contract)`

    * Acquire the contract `c` at the point when observable quantity `p` becomes `true`.
* `Anytime(p::Observable{Bool}, c::Contract)`

    * May acquire the contract `c` at any point when observable quantity `p` is `true`.
* `Until(p::Observable{Bool}, c::Contract)`

    * A contract that acts like contract `c` until `p` is `true`, at which point the object is abandoned, and hence becomes worthless.

### Primitive Observables

Like `Contract`, `Observable{T}` is defined as an abstract type.  Specific instances of an `Observable` type are objects, possibly time-varying, and possibly unknown at contracting time, for which a direct measurement can be made.  Example observable quantities include date, price, temperature, population or other objects that can be objectively measured.

Built-in primitive `Observable` types include the following:

* `DateObs() <: Observable{Date}`

    * A singleton type representing the "free" date observable
* `AcquisitionDateObs() <: Observable{Date}`

    * The acquisition date of the contract
* `ConstObs{T} <: Observable{T}`

    * A constant observable quantity
    * `ConstObs(x)` - Constructor function for a constant observable of value `x`

### Derived Observables

Built-in derived observable types include the following:

* `At(t::Date) <: Observable{Bool}`

    * `At(t::Date) = LiftObs(==,DateObs(),ConstObs(t))`
    * An observable that is `true` when the date is `t`
    * This type of observable is used as part of the construction of the derived contract primitives `ZCB`, `WhenAt`, `Forward`, and `European`

* `BeforeObs(t::Date) <: Observable{Bool}`

    * `BeforeObs(t::Date) = LiftObs(<=,DateObs(),ConstObs(t))`
    * An observable that is `true` when the date is before or equal to `t`
    * This type of observable is useds as part of the construction of the derived contract primitives `AnytimeBefore` and `American`

Each of these derived `Observable` types makes use of a `LiftObs` operation.  

`LiftObs` is defined as an `immutable` type whose type constructor applies a function to one or more existing `Observable` quantities to produce a new `Observable`.

## Constructing Observables and Contracts

To provide an example of how one goes about using the above primitive and derived `Observable` types, let's return to one of the operations from the opening "Motivting Example" section.  We will break apart each piece of the constructed zero coupon bond, to point out the specific `Contract` and `Observable` components utilized.

Defining the acquisition of rights to a contract on a given date
```@example motivating
x = When(At(Date("2016-12-25")), Receive(100USD))
```

Constructing a zero coupon bond with a function having the same components as in the previous operation
```@example motivating
z = ZCB(Date("2016-12-25"), 100USD)
```

The most basic primitives in the above zero coupon bond construction are the `Amount` primitive `Contract` type used for representing the value of 100, the `CurrencyUnit` and `CurrencyQuantity` types used when representing USD, and the `DateObs` primitive `Observable` type used for representing the a `Date`.

The expression `Receive(100USD)` creates a `Contract` object that provides acquisition rights to 100USD.

The expression `At(Date("2016-12-25"))` creates a new `LiftObs` observable object that is `true` when the current date in the valuation model is "2016-12-25".  The implementation of the `At` observable type constructor includes the following operations:

```@example lift
using Miletus, Dates # hide
import Miletus: LiftObs, DateObs, ConstObs # hide

const At = LiftObs{typeof(==),Tuple{DateObs,ConstObs{Date}},Bool}

At(t::Date) = LiftObs(==,DateObs(),ConstObs(t))

const At = At

nothing # hide
```

The arguments to `LiftObs` in the definition of `At` include:

* The `==` function that will be applied to two observable values on date quantities
* A `DateObs` object that acts as a reference observable quantity for the "Current Date" when valuing a model
* An input date `t` which becomes a constant observable quantity `ConstObs(t)` to which the reference observable is compared when valuing a contract.

The commands below show both the hierarchy of observables and the type of the result returned by a call to `At`.

```@example motivating
At(Date("2016-12-25"))
```

```@example motivating
typeof(At(Date("2016-12-25")))
```

With use of the `When` primitive `Contract`, the combination of our defined `Receive(100USD)` `Contract` object with the above `At(Date("2016-12-25"))` `Observable` object constructs new a zero coupon bond `Contract` that defines a payment of 100USD to the holder on December 25th, 2016.

The concept of optionality provides a contract acquirer with a choice on whether to exercise particular rights embedded in that contract.  The most basic `Contract` primitives representing optionality in Miletus are the `Either` and `Cond` primitives described previously.

Adjusting the zero coupon bond example above to incorporate the `Either`, `Both` and `At` `Contract` and `Observable` primitives allow for implementing a European Call option as repeated below.

```@example motivating
x = When(At(Date("2016-12-25")), Either(Both(SingleStock(), Pay(100USD)), Zero()))
```

The above operations are defined as the typealias EuropeanCall
```@example motivating
eucall = EuropeanCall(Date("2016-12-25"), SingleStock(), 100USD)
```

By combining various `Contract` and `Observable` primitives, contract payoffs of arbitrary complexity can be constructed easily.

The next section lists a number of built-in derived contracts that combine the above primitives in the defintion of various types of options instruments.

## Built-in Derived Contracts

By combining these contract primitives, a set of `typealias` quantities are defined that allow for more compact syntax when creating various derived contracts.  Using these type aliases, a set of constructors for these derived contracts are defined as shown below:

* `Receive(x::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = Amount(ConstObs(x))`

    * Receive an amount of a particular real valued object or currency

* `Pay(x::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = Give(Receive(x))`

    * Pay an amount of a particular real valued object or currency

* `Buy(c::Contract, x::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = Both(c, Pay(x))`

    * Purchase a contract `c` for an amount of a particular real valued object or currency

* `Sell(c::Contract, x::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = Both(Give(c), Receive(x))`

    * Sell a contract `c` for an amount of a particular real valued object or currency

* `ZCB(date::Date, x::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = When(At(date), Receive(x))`

    * A "Zero Coupon Bond" that provides for obtaining a particular amount of a real valued object or currency on a particular maturity `date`

* `WhenAt(date::Date, c::Contract) = When(At(date), c)`

    * Activate the contract `c` on the particular maturity `date`

* `Forward(date::Date, c::Contract, strike::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = WhenAt(date, Buy(c, strike))`

    * Purchase a contract `c` for a particular amount of a real valued object or currency (`strike`) on a particular maturity `date`

* `Option(c::Contract) = Either(c, Zero())`

    * Activate either contract `c` or nothing

* `European(date::Date, c::Contract) = WhenAt(date, Option(c))`

    * On a particular maturity `date` acquire either contract `c` or nothing

* `EuropeanCall(date::Date, c::Contract, strike::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = European(date, Buy(c, strike))`

    * A European call contract, with maturity `date`, on underlying contract `c` at price `strike`

* `EuropeanPut(date::Date, c::Contract, strike::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = European(date, Sell(c, strike))`

    * A European put contract, with maturity `date`, on underlying contract `c` at price `strike`

* `AnytimeBefore(date::Date, c::Contract) = Anytime(BeforeObs(date), c)`

    * Activate the contract `c` anytime before a particular maturity `date`

* `American(date::Date, c::Contract) = AnytimeBefore(date, Option(c))`

    * Either activate the contract `c` or nothing anytime before a particular maturity `date`

* `AmericanCall(date::Date, c::Contract, strike::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = American(date, Buy(c, strike))`

    * An American call contract, with maturity `date`, on underlying contract `c` at price `strike`

* `AmericanPut(date::Date, c::Contract, strike::Union{Real,CurrencyQuantity}) = American(date, Sell(c, strike))`

    * An American put contract, with maturity `date`, on underlying contract `c` at price `strike`

* `AsianFixedStrikeCall(dt::Date, c::Contract, period::Period, strike) = European(dt, Buy(MovingAveragePrice(c, period), strike))`

    * An Asian option contract where the strike price is constant and whose pay off is based on the moving average price of the underlying over the life of the contract.

* `AsianFloatingStrikeCall(dt::Date, c::Contract, period::Period, strike) = European(dt, Both(c, Give(MovingAveragePrice(c, period))))`

    * An Asian option contract where the strike price and payoff are based on the moving average price of the underlying over the life of the contract.

## DayCounts

Miletus provides implementations of a number of separate calendar implementations that take into consideration day count conventions from different countries and financial organizations worldwide.  Each day count type is an instance of an abstract `DayCount` type.

Specific `DayCount` instances present in Miletus include:

* [Actual360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#Actual.2F360) - Uses a coupon factor equal to the number of days between two dates in a Julian calendar divided by 360.
* [Actual365](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#Actual.2F365_Fixed) - Uses a coupon factor equal to the number of days between two dates in a Julian calendar divided by 365.
* [BondThirty360 / USAThirty360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#30.2F360_US) - Uses a coupon factor equal to the number of days between two dates assuming 30 days in any month and 360 days in a year.  Used for the pricing of US Corporate Bonds and many US agency bond issues.
* [EuroBondThirty360 / EuroThirty360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#30E.2F360) - Uses a coupon factor equal to the number of days between two dates assuming 30 days in any month and 360 dates in a year.
* ItalianThirty360
* [ISMAActualActual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#Actual.2FActual_ICMA)
* [ISDAActualActual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#Actual.2FActual_ISDA)
* [AFBActualActual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention#Actual.2FActual_AFB)

For each `DayCount` type, the `yearfraction` function provides the fractional position within the associated year for a provided input date.

Modifying a particular date in the course of a calculation often needs to take into account the above `DayCount` convention, as well as a relevant holiday calendar.  The `adjust` function takes into account holidays through functionality used from the `HolidayCalendar` included `BusinessDays` package.

## Processes

In the context of the contract definition language implemented by Miletus, a `Process`, `p(t)`, is a mapping from time to a random variable of a particular type.  Both `Contract` objects and `Observable` objects can be modeled as a `Process`.  Like `Contract` and `Observable`, a `Process` is defined in Miletus as an abstract type, where subtypes of `Process` are implemented as immutable types.

The following `Process` types are available for operating on `Contract` and `Observable` objects

* `DateProcess()` - maps an `Observable` date to the given date.
* `ConstProcess(val::T)` - maps an `Observable` value to a constant value (`val::T`) for all times.
* `CondProcess(cond::Process{Bool}, a::Process{T}, b::Process{T})` - based on first `Process` boolean value, maps to one of two distinct `Process` values.

## Term Structures

Term Structures provide a framework for representing how interest rates for a given set of modeling assumptions change through time.

* TermStruct - An abstract type that is a super type to all Term Structures implmented in Miletus
* YieldTermStructure - An abstract type that encompasses various interest rate term structure models
* VolatilityTermStructure - An abstract type that encompasses various volatility term structure models
* ConstantYieldCurve - A concrete type encompassing a constant interest rate model
* ConstantVolatilityCurve - A concrete type encompassing a constant volatility model

* compound_factor - Multiplicative factor using the frequency and method by accumulated interest is included in principle for the purporses of interest rate calculations
* discount_factor - Inverse of the above compound_factor
* implied_rate - Determination of the current interest rate implied from the compounding factor
* forward_rate - A rate of interest as implied by the current zero rate of a given YieldTermStructure for periods of time in the future.
* zero_rate - The implied spot interest rate for a given YieldTermStructure and time horizon
* par_rate - A coupon rate for which a bond price equals its nominal value

# Models

A valuation model encompasses both the analytical mathematical description of the dynamics involved in how an observable quantity changes through time, as well as a numerical method used for discretizing and solving those analytical equations.

There are a wide variety of different analytical models for describing the value dynamics of interest rates, stocks, bonds, credit instruments (e.g. mortgages, credit cards, other loans) and other securities.  With regards to numerical methods, most techniques fall into one of four distinct categories; Analytical Methods (closed-form equations), Lattice Methods (e.g. trees), Monte Carlo Methods, and Partial Differential Equation solvers (e.g. finite difference, finite element).

The `Contract` and `Observable` primitives described previously are used for setting up payoffs that act as boundary conditions and final conditions on the use of a model to value an instrument.

## Implemented Models and Valuation methods

* Core Model (objective assumptions underlying the model. everything except volatility. objective parameters that can be observed in the market)

* Core Forward Model

* Yield Curves and Dates

* Geometric Brownian Motion

    * `GeomBMModel(startdate, startprice, interestrate, carryrate, volatility)`

       * A model for a `SingleStock`, following a geometric Brownian motion that includes the following fields:

         * `startdate`
         * `startprice`: initial price at `startdate`
         * `interestrate`: risk free rate of return.
         * `carryrate`: the carry rate, i.e. the net return for holding the asset:

           * for stocks this is typically positive (i.e. dividends)
           * for commodities this is typically negative (i.e. cost-of-carry)
        * `volatility`:

           * The `interestrate`, `carryrate` and `volatility` are all specified on a continuously compounded, Actual/365 basis.
           * The price is assumed to follow the PDE:
          $dS_t = (\kappa - \sigma^2/2) S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$
           * where $W_t$ is a Wiener process, and `κ = interestrate - carryrate`.
      * Associated valuation routines make use of analytical methods for solving the Black-Scholes equation, or when determining implied volatitilies based on the Black-Scholes equation.

* Binomial Geometric Random Walk

    * `BinomialGeomRWModel(startdate, enddate, nsteps, S₀, Δt, iR, logu, logd, p, q)`

       * A model for a Binomial Geometric Random Walk (aka Binomial tree)
       * The valuation routines for binomial trees are initialized using the payoff condition of the associated contract at expiry(`enddate`) and subsequently work backward in time through the tree to determine the value of the contract at the initial time (`startdate`).
      * Includes the following fields (or the `log` of those values)

         * `startdate` : start date of process
         * `enddate` : end date of process
         * `nsteps` : number of steps in the tree
         * `S₀` : initial value
         * `Δt` : the time-difference between steps, typically `days(startdate - enddate) / (365*nsteps)`
         * `iR` : discount rate, `exp(-Δt*interestrate)`
         * `u`  : scale factor for up
         * `d`  : scale factor for down
         * `p`  : up probability
         * `q`  : down probability, `1-p`

# Greeks

Miletus allows for generic derivatives of contract prices with respect to different metrics (otherwise known as greeks)

Consider the following contract:

```@example greeks
using Miletus, Dates
d1 = today()                                                                
d2 = d1 + Day(150)                                                          
c = EuropeanCall(d2, SingleStock(), 56.5USD)                               
```

Now let us set up a model according to which we want the contract valued

```@example greeks
core = CoreModel(d1, 47.32USD, 0.0, 0.0)                                   
gbm = GeomBMModel(core, 0.1)                                              
```

Calculate `delta` greek:

```@example greeks
delta(gbm, c)
```

Other functions available:

* `vega`
* `rho`
* `gamma`

Miletus also allows you to calculate generic nth derivatives with respect to
various metrics. The following expression evaluates the third derivative of
the contract value with respect to volatility:

```@example greeks
greek(gbm, c; metric = :vol, n = 3)
```
